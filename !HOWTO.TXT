1. Type in address: chrome://chrome/extensions/
2. Click on "Load unpacked extension..." button
3. Navigate to extension folder and press "OK" button
// by default, all features are off, you need to turn them on
4. Go to "Options" page of extension (you find it on page: chrome://chrome/extensions/, under "Lukas Tencer's modification of instant messaging client imo.im (beta)")
5. Check in required features and press save.
6 Reload imo.im.

NOTE: there is currently bug present if you check/uncheck options, you need to press "Reload" for extension options, I hope to fix it soon.
